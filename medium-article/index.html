      <h2>Military Method</h2>
      <p>The military method is a technique that focuses on muscle relaxation, breathing, and mental visualization. Here's how to fall asleep fast with the military method:
        <ol>
          <li>Lay down on your bed.</li>
          <li>Beginning with your face, tense your muscles and then loosen them as you take deep, calming breaths.</li>
          <li>Repeat this process down your body until you feel at ease.</li>
          <li>Clear your mind. Then, picture a relaxing scenario like peacefully lying in a canoe on a calm lake or gently rocking back and forth in a completely dark room.</li>
        </ol>
      If this doesn't work, repeat “don't think” to yourself for 10 seconds and try again.
      The military method works better as you get more practice with it, so don't give up if you have trouble clearing your mind right away. Over time, this technique should help you get to sleep in less and less time.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Use The 4-7-8 Method</h2>
      <p>With the 4-7-8 method, you focus on counting to distract yourself from feelings of anxiety. Here's how to sleep faster with the 4-7-8 method:
        <ol>
          <li>While laying down in bed, relax your tongue and rest it on the roof of your mouth.</li>
          <li>Slowly exhale through your mouth, completely emptying your lungs.</li>
          <li>Breath in through your nose for four seconds.</li>
          <li>Hold your breath for seven seconds.</li>
          <li>Exhale for eight seconds.</li>
          <li>Repeat this process at least four times.</li>
        </ol>
        The 4-7-8 method is based on Pranayama, a traditional yoga technique. Research supports that Pranayama can ease anxiety and lull you into a state of calm, thus helping you fall asleep faster.

      <h2>3. Turn Down Your Tech</h2>
      <p>With the prevalence of modern technology, surfing the internet before bed is more of a given than a question. While it can be tough to turn off your tech, looking at your screen before bed can negatively impact your quality of sleep.
        Many devices emit a blue light that simulates sunlight — and while this is helpful before your morning coffee, it can do more harm than good when trying to hit the hay.
        If you're not able to completely part with your devices for an hour before bed, consider turning down your tech instead. Try reducing screen time by:
        <ol>
          <li>Listening to music</li>
          <li>Tuning into a calming podcast</li>
          <li>Playing an audiobook</li>
        </ol>
        If you can't pull away from the screen at night, browse your device's settings to see if there's a night mode. This typically will make the screen warmer colors, reducing the effects of blue light on sleep.
